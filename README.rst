Description
===========

Code to compute polyspectrum from a 3D grid following the method described in Watkinson et al. (2017).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**: This is work in progress and code has not been fully tested. Currently only powerspectra and bispectra are supported. Suggestions for improvements can be sent to `a.k.hutter@rug.nl`.

Installation
============

Pre-requisities
---------------

Serial run
``````````

1. fftw3 library: ``fftw3 >= 3.3.3``

Parallel run
````````````

1. MPI library
2. fftw3 & fftw3-mpi library: ``fftw3 >= 3.3.3``

FFTW3
'''''

Go to the `FFTW webpage <http://www.fftw.org/download.html>`__ to install fftw3. Ensure to compile the library with the ``enable-mpi`` flag for parallel runs
::
    
    $ ./configure --enable-mpi
    $ make
    $ make install
    
Note: To create the dynamic libraries, run configure with the ``--enable-shared`` flag. 


Download & Build
----------------

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/annehutter/polyspectrum.git
    $ make

This will download the code and first test case from the github directory and compile the source code.

Execution
---------

The first test case can then be run by
::

    $ ./polyspectrum iniFile.ini

``iniFile.ini`` contains all input parameters that are needed for any runs. For a different simulation the code does not need to be recompiled but just this parameter file iniFile.ini to be adapted.


Parameter file
``````````````
The following parameters are specified in ``iniFile.ini``:

**Grid**
........

- ``gridsize``: size of the 3D grid along one axis
- ``boxsize``: comoving boxsize in Mpc/h

- ``gasInputsInDoublePrecision``: set to 0 for single, 1 for double precision for density fields being read
- ``ionInputsInDoublePrecision``: set to 0 for single, 1 for double precision for ionization fields being read
- ``densityFile``: path to 3D density grid
- ``ionFile``: pathr to 3D ionization grid

**Cosmology**
.............

- ``hubble_h``: H = 100*hubble_h km/s/Mpc
- ``omega_b``: baryon density parameter
- ``omega_m``: matter density parameter
- ``omega_l``: lambda density parameter
- ``Y``: mass fraction of Helium in the primordial gas (assumed to consist of H and He)

**Polyspectrum**
................

- ``whichField``: field from which the polyspectrum is calculated; options are: ``DENS`` for density, ``XHII`` for ionization fraction and ``XHI_DENS`` for neutral gas density
- ``n``: number of vectors, i.e. ``n=2`` yields powerspectrum, ``n=3`` yields bispectrum
- ``k1``: length of first vector in Mpc/h
- ``k2``: length of second vector in Mpc/h (if n>2)
- ``numValues``: set to 1, if only single value for polyspectrum should be calculated; for >1 and ``n>2`` number of k bins along ``theta = 0 to 180Â°``
- ``theta``: angle between ``k1`` and ``k2`` in rad

**Output**
..........

- ``output_dir``: directory where output should be written
- ``output_basename``: output name of the run
